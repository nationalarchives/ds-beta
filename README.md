# HTML prototypes

This repository holds static HTML prototypes for the Etna project.

## Working with the code

Steps:

- Install **PHP 8** - run `brew update` then `brew upgrade php` if you use a Mac with Homebrew to update your PHP version.
- Run `php -S localhost:8000` from the root to start the server. You can use any port you like instead of 8000.
- Install [Sass](https://sass-lang.com) globally with `npm install -g sass`
- Kick off a Sass watch task with `sass --watch styles/styles.scss styles/dist/styles.css`
