                            <p>William Shakespeare is often thought of as one of the greatest writers in the English language. His plays have been translated
                                into every major language, and are performed more often than any other playwright. Shakespeare’s writing also affected the way the
                                English language evolved, and several words and phrases, such as ‘all’s well that ends well’, ‘with bated breath’ and ‘a foregone conclusion’
                                have moved into everyday use.</p>

                    <p>
                        William Shakespeare, also known as the ‘Bard’, was born in Stratford-upon-Avon on April 23rd 1564. It is thought he married his wife,
                        Anne Hathaway, in 1582, although we have no specific marriage certificate. He pursued a career as an actor, poet and dramatist in London.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        His now famous plays were performed widely during his lifetime, often at the purpose-built Globe Theatre in London on the south bank of
                        the Thames. The first folio was published in 1623, with 154 sonnets, 37 plays, and 2 long poems. It is suggested that his friends put it
                        together in case others tried to copy Shakespeare’s work and claim it as their own.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since then, he has become internationally renowned as the world’s greatest ever playwright.

                                        The portrait shows a balding man, dark haired, rather askew of eye, and wearing a white lace collar of a type familiar
                                        to anyone who has read anything about William Shakespeare. The image itself is quite easily explained. It is a pencil
                                        copy, made in the 19th century by an antiquarian and archivist, of a 17th century portrait. But is this an image of
                                        Shakespeare, and why is it in the collections of The National Archives at all?

                        Six shillings and eight pence is what Shakespeare’s company of actors, the Lord Chamberlain’s Men, were charged for the
                        first stage of a bureaucratic process to gain a licence granting them the patronage of the new king, James I; henceforth,
                        the company would be known as the King’s Men. It was expensive – at the time, actors in London were normally paid less
                        than one shilling a day – but it was to prove a wise investment.

                            Whilst the registry record of Shakespeare’s birth is held in Stratford-upon-Avon and his November 28th 1582 marriage
                            bond to Anne Hathaway is now in Worcestershire Record Office, a series of important records of his life are held at
                            The National Archives, including pleadings and depositions in three lawsuits in the Court of Requests involving
                            Shakespeare.
