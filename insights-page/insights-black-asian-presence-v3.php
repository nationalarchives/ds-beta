            <h2>Introduction: Arriving in Britain</h2>
            <p>
                People of African and Asian origin have lived in Britain for at least two millennia. They arrived here many hundreds of years
                before the massive forced migrations sparked by the slave trade and the British colonisation of India. And by the time the SS
                Windrush arrived in 1948, famously carrying the first postwar arrivals from the Caribbean, Britain had a firmly established
                Black and Asian population.

                    Between 1678 and 1682, Jean Barbot, a French commercial agent, traded for gold along the Gold Coast (now Ghana),
                    in West Africa. This drawing is taken from his journals, held by The National Archives. In his journals, among a variety
                    of observations on African life, Barbot describes how gold is mined. Methods used include panning for gold dust and,
                    as shown here, diving for nuggets in the local rivers. Intriguingly, and despite his having first-hand knowledge of the
                    area, both Barbot’s report on gold mining and his drawing rely on material in other sources. This drawing, for example,
                    almost entirely reproduces the one in an earlier work by Olfert Dapper, a Dutch scholar who had never even visited
                    Africa.

            <h2>What Do We Know?</h2>
            <p>
                There were many Asian and Black people living in Britain throughout the period covered by this exhibition (1500-1850).
            </p>
            <p>
                It is often assumed that the population of Britain was entirely White at this period. How many people know, for example,
                that one of the leaders of the radical Chartist movement, which fought for the vote in the 19th century, was Black?
                Or that Elizabeth I tried to expel a number of Black people from England? Or that thousands of Black men, and probably
                even a few Black women, fought in the British army and navy during the Napoleonic Wars?
            </p>
            <p>
                There is much historical evidence about Black people in Britain, and this exhibition explores some of it. But many subjects
                have not been researched, and there is much that we still do not know.

            <h2>Early Migrations</h2>
            <p>
                In Roman times, Black troops were sent to the remote and barbaric province of Britannia, and some of them stayed when
                the Roman legions left Britain. Later on, in the Middle Ages, Moors arrived in Britain. They probably came, directly or
                indirectly, from Spain, which had been conquered by Muslims from North and Northwest Africa in the 8th century.

            <h2>Africans in Britain</h2>
            <p>
                British involvement in the slave trade began in the 16th century and had reached huge proportions by the 18th. Over a period
                of 400 years, Europeans transported many millions of Africans to labour in their colonies in the Americas. These migrations
                created the Black diaspora.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here, they were not necessarily treated significantly more humanely than they were on the plantations and their legal status
                (‘free’ or ‘enslaved’) was extensively argued in a series of court cases.

                    This image, from the Gentleman's Magazine, shows Ayuba Suleiman Diallo (here called by the English version of his
                    name, Job ben Solomon), the son of a Muslim imam from Gambia, and William Ansah Sessarakoo, a prince from Ghana.
                    They were both tricked into slavery, but freed on account of their noble origins and education. Sessarakoo lived in
                    England from 1749 to 1750.

                    Solomon travelled to England after spending time on a plantation in Maryland. He became something of a celebrity
                    and was 'graciously received by nobility'. Dressed in an African gown, he was presented to the king and queen. After
                    spending some time in England, he was taken back to Africa by the Royal African Company.

                        period of the British slave trade, c1660-1807. Kathleen worked for the BBC until 1994. One of her interests was family
                        history so when she left  she became self-employed as a writer of books and articles on aspects of history and also as

                        Stephen Bourne talks about his latest book, Black Poppies, published by The History Press to coincide with the centenary
                        of the First World War. Black Poppies explores the military and civilian wartime experiences of Britain’s black community,
                        from the trenches to the music halls. Poignantly, it concludes by examining the anti-black ‘race riots’ of 1919. In cities
                        such as Cardiff and Liverpool, black citizens came under attack from returning white soldiers who resented their presence,
                        in spite of what they and their families had done for Britain during the war.

                                    In Shakespeare’s day women could not act in public and female roles were performed by boys and young men.
                                    However, what is less well known is there were children’s companies entirely comprised of young boys who played
                                    both male and female roles. The Children of the Chapel was one of the most famous, and this blog will explore some
                                    of the more extreme methods they went to in order to recruit boys actors

                                    The actor Edward Alleyn and his father-in-law Philip Henslowe built and expanded several London public
                                    playhouses, including the Rose, the Fortune, and the Hope. Named by King James VI and I as Joint ‘Masters of
                                    the Royal Game of Bears, Bulls and Mastiff Dogs’, Henslowe and Alleyn also staged such blood sports as bull- and
                                    bear- and lion-baiting at the Bear Garden and other venues, including royal palaces. They also commissioned
                                    plays and ran acting companies.

                                    In this talk, the project team will ask the fundamental question, ‘what is a playhouse?’, and explore surviving
                                    documents that tell us what we know about these spaces, and rethink the builders, managers, and audiences
                                    who brought them into being.
