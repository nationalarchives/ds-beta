                            <p>William Shakespeare is often thought of as one of the greatest writers in the English language. His plays have been translated
                                into every major language, and are performed more often than any other playwright. Shakespeare’s writing also affected the way the
                                English language evolved, and several words and phrases, such as ‘all’s well that ends well’, ‘with bated breath’ and ‘a foregone conclusion’
                                have moved into everyday use.</p>

                        <h2>Career</h2>
                        <p>
                            William Shakespeare, also known as the ‘Bard’, was born in Stratford-upon-Avon on April 23rd 1564. It is thought he married his wife,
                            Anne Hathaway, in 1582, although we have no specific marriage certificate. He pursued a career as an actor, poet and dramatist in London.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            His now famous plays were performed widely during his lifetime, often at the purpose-built Globe Theatre in London on the south bank of
                            the Thames. The first folio was published in 1623, with 154 sonnets, 37 plays, and 2 long poems. It is suggested that his friends put it
                            together in case others tried to copy Shakespeare’s work and claim it as their own.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Since then, he has become internationally renowned as the world’s greatest ever playwright.

                        <p>
                            Six shillings and eight pence is what Shakespeare’s company of actors, the Lord Chamberlain’s Men, were charged for the
                            first stage of a bureaucratic process to gain a licence granting them the patronage of the new king, James I; henceforth,
                            the company would be known as the King’s Men. It was expensive – at the time, actors in London were normally paid less
                            than one shilling a day – but it was to prove a wise investment.

                            On 25 March 1616, William Shakespeare made his will, signed ‘by me, William Shakspeare’. He probably died in April, after
                            finalising his will over the preceding months, but scholars are unsure of the exact date of his death.
