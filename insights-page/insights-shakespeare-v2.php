                    <p>
                        William Shakespeare, also known as the ‘Bard’, was born in Stratford-upon-Avon on April 23rd 1564. It is thought he married his wife,
                        Anne Hathaway, in 1582, although we have no specific marriage certificate. He pursued a career as an actor, poet and dramatist in London.

                    <p>
                        His now famous plays were performed widely during his lifetime, often at the purpose-built Globe Theatre in London on the south bank of
                        the Thames. The first folio was published in 1623, with 154 sonnets, 37 plays, and 2 long poems. It is suggested that his friends put it
                        together in case others tried to copy Shakespeare’s work and claim it as their own.

                        Since then, he has become internationally renowned as the world’s greatest ever playwright.

                                            to anyone who has read anything about William Shakespeare. The image itself is quite easily explained. It is a pencil
                                            copy, made in the 19th century by an antiquarian and archivist, of a 17th century portrait. But is this an image of
                                            Shakespeare, and why is it in the collections of The National Archives at all?

                        Six shillings and eight pence is what Shakespeare’s company of actors, the Lord Chamberlain’s Men, were charged for the
                        first stage of a bureaucratic process to gain a licence granting them the patronage of the new king, James I; henceforth,
                        the company would be known as the King’s Men. It was expensive – at the time, actors in London were normally paid less
                        than one shilling a day – but it was to prove a wise investment.

                                On 25 March 1616, William Shakespeare made his will, signed ‘by me, William Shakespeare’. He probably died in April, after
                                finalising his will over the preceding months, but scholars are unsure of the exact date of his death. As Head of Legal

                                    In Shakespeare’s day women could not act in public and female roles were performed by boys and young men.
                                    However, what is less well known is there were children’s companies entirely comprised of young boys who played
                                    both male and female roles. The Children of the Chapel was one of the most famous, and this blog will explore some
                                    of the more extreme methods they went to in order to recruit boys actors

                                <p>
                                    The actor Edward Alleyn and his father-in-law Philip Henslowe built and expanded several London public
                                    playhouses, including the Rose, the Fortune, and the Hope. Named by King James VI and I as Joint ‘Masters of
                                    the Royal Game of Bears, Bulls and Mastiff Dogs’, Henslowe and Alleyn also staged such blood sports as bull- and
                                    bear- and lion-baiting at the Bear Garden and other venues, including royal palaces. They also commissioned
                                    plays and ran acting companies.

                                    In this talk, the project team will ask the fundamental question, ‘what is a playhouse?’, and explore surviving
                                    documents that tell us what we know about these spaces, and rethink the builders, managers, and audiences
                                    who brought them into being.
