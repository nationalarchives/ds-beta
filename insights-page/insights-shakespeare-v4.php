            <p>His plays have been translated into every major language, and are performed more often than any other playwright. Shakespeare’s writing also affected the way the English language evolved, and several words and phrases, such as ‘all’s well that ends well’, ‘with bated breath’ and ‘a foregone conclusion’ have moved into everyday use.</p>

            <h2>Shakespeare's career</h2>
            <p>William Shakespeare, also known as the ‘Bard’, was born in Stratford-upon-Avon on April 23rd 1564. It is thought he married his wife, Anne Hathaway, in 1582, although we have no specific marriage certificate. He pursued a career as an actor, poet and dramatist in London.</p>
            <p>His now famous plays were performed widely during his lifetime, often at the purpose-built Globe Theatre in London on the south bank of the Thames. The first folio was published in 1623, with 154 sonnets, 37 plays, and 2 long poems. It is suggested that his friends put it together in case others tried to copy Shakespeare’s work and claim it as their own.</p>
            <p>Since then, he has become internationally renowned as the world’s greatest ever playwright.</p>

                <p>The portrait shows a balding man, dark haired, rather askew of eye, and wearing a white lace collar of a type familiar to anyone who has read anything about William Shakespeare. The image itself is quite easily explained. It is a pencil copy, made in the 19th century by an antiquarian and archivist, of a 17th century portrait. But is this an image of Shakespeare, and why is it in the collections of The National Archives at all?</p>
                <p>The expert among whose papers it was found was Rawdon Lubbock Brown who, as you may have read in a blog earlier this year, was among the staff of the then-Public Record Office… but in Venice.</p>

                    <p class="caption-text bold-text">Tuesday 13 September 2016</p>
                    <p>Discover what it was like to wander the streets of Shakespeare’s London. Though large portions of the city from Shakespeare’s time have since been destroyed by fire, war and developers, a surprising number of buildings and places still survive. Author David Thomas discusses the sights, cuisine and pastimes of 16th century Londoners, while providing insight into what it was like to be a tourist during Shakespeare’s lifetime. Please note that there are occasional disruptions to the sound quality during this recording.</p>

            <p>Six shillings and eight pence is what Shakespeare’s company of actors, the Lord Chamberlain’s Men, were charged for the first stage of a bureaucratic process to gain a licence granting them the patronage of the new king, James I; henceforth, the company would be known as the King’s Men. It was expensive – at the time, actors in London were normally paid less than one shilling a day – but it was to prove a wise investment.</p>
            <p>This information has recently come to light in a new examination of a document in The National Archives by Dr Hannah Crummé.</p>

The last will and testament helps us to learn about Shakespeare at the end of his life, providing us with minute details about his final wishes. The source evidence in this lesson shows that he was a man of considerable wealth by the time he died, and that most of it was left to his eldest daughter, Susanna Hall. The will also provides us with three of only six surviving samples of his signature.</p>

                        On 25 March 1616, William Shakespeare made his will, signed ‘by me, William Shakespeare’. He probably died in April, after
                        finalising his will over the preceding months, but scholars are unsure of the exact date of his death. As Head of Legal
                        Records at The National Archives, I've been looking in detail at one of our treasures: Shakespeare's original will, full of
                        amendments, which was left in the probate court by his executor.

                                    In Shakespeare’s day women could not act in public and female roles were performed by boys and young men.
                                    However, what is less well known is there were children’s companies entirely comprised of young boys who played
                                    both male and female roles. The Children of the Chapel was one of the most famous, and this blog will explore some
                                    of the more extreme methods they went to in order to recruit boys actors

                                    The actor Edward Alleyn and his father-in-law Philip Henslowe built and expanded several London public
                                    playhouses, including the Rose, the Fortune, and the Hope. Named by King James VI and I as Joint ‘Masters of
                                    the Royal Game of Bears, Bulls and Mastiff Dogs’, Henslowe and Alleyn also staged such blood sports as bull- and
                                    bear- and lion-baiting at the Bear Garden and other venues, including royal palaces. They also commissioned
                                    plays and ran acting companies.
