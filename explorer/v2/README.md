This version was iterated on from V1. These changes were made quite rapidly as there was a 48 hour development window before pilot testing, so code quality may not be the best.

- Real content and images was asked to be added. 
- Only topics and themes were asked to be shown on the homepage.
- Dates were removed from results. 
- Search was removed from the homepage. 
- All tab elements were removed.
